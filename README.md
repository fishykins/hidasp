# hid and seek protocol (hidasp)
<div id="top"></div>

[![Minimum Supported Rust Version]][Rust 1.56]

provides a mapping solution for devices using the Windows [HID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/) protocol.
This mapping is agnostic: it simply provides a coherent instruction set for reading device buffers.
Various utilities are included to help with common functionality, such as data parsing, mpa building, etc.
